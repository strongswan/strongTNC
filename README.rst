strongTNC is a Trusted Network Connect (TNC) extension for the strongSwan VPN
solution. It allows the definition and enforcement of TNC policies that apply
to all VPN clients and must be fulfilled with each connection attempt.


Development Setup
-----------------

strongTNC uses Django (currently version 1.6.x). It is recommended to use the
pip_ and virtualenv_ tools to ease the dependency management. They can be
installed via your package manager on most Linux distributions.

If you're new to these tools: Pip is the de-facto Python package manager
(similar to apt-get or yum). And virtualenv is a tool that allows you to have
multiple Python installations side-by-side, inside a directory. A quickstart
guide can be found `here
<https://blog.dbrgn.ch/2012/9/18/virtualenv-quickstart/>`__.

First, create a virtualenv::

    cd /path/to/strongTNC/
    virtualenv --no-site-packages VIRTUAL
    source VIRTUAL/bin/activate

Then install the dependencies::

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Now you can start the development server. ::

    ./manage.py runserver

The web interface should be available on ``http://localhost:8000/``. The
default password is ``password``.

If you want to use the django debug toolbar, install it via pip::

    pip install django-debug-toolbar

Then start the server with the ``DJANGO_DEBUG_TOOLBAR`` env variable set to
``1`` or ``True``. ::

    DJANGO_DEBUG_TOOLBAR=1 ./manage.py runserver


Testing
-------

Install pytest & dependencies::

    pip install -r requirements-tests.txt

Run the tests::

    ./runtests.py
